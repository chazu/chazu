I have over a decade's professional experience in software engineering, most of which I've spent practicing Platform Engineering for SaaS startups.

I love solving higher-order engineering problems.

I love extensibiliy and simplicity

I also love finding the irreducible complexity/complicatedness in the problem

I love collaboration and teaching others

I love computers, even though they were a mistake.
